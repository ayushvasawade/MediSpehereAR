MediSphereAR 🧠📱
From Raw Reports to 3D Organs — In Your Hands.

🚀 Project Overview
MediSphereAR is a revolutionary medical technology pipeline that transforms raw MRI and CT scan reports into patient-specific 3D organ models and brings them into Augmented Reality (AR).
Designed for surgical planning, medical education, and patient understanding, MediSphereAR closes the gap between complex medical data and real-world visualization.

🔥 Key Features
Automated Data Extraction
Parses raw radiology reports to extract organ names, abnormal findings (tumors, cysts, stones, lesions), and their dimensions.
Real-world Dimension Mapping
Converts biological measurements into Blender-compatible units for precise model generation.
Dynamic 3D Model Building
Patient-specific organ models are built based on extracted report data, highlighting pathological features.
Immersive Augmented Reality Integration
View, rotate, and study the 3D organ models in real-world AR using a phone or tablet.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python (Data Extraction Engine)
3D Modeling: Blender
AR Engine: Unity / WebXR (or mention what you're using)
Additional Tools: Regex, Natural Language Processing (NLP) for report understanding

✨ How It Works
Input:
User uploads or pastes a raw text MRI/CT scan report.
Extraction:
Our custom Python engine:
Identifies the organ
Detects conditions (tumors, cysts, etc.)
Extracts precise size measurements
3D Model Generation:
Blender uses extracted data to build a real-world scale, patient-specific model.
Augmented Reality Projection:
The generated model is anchored into AR space for viewing and study.

📈 Business Use Cases
Hospitals — Accurate pre-surgical planning tools
Medical Colleges — Immersive anatomy and pathology education
Health-tech Apps — Integration via white-labeled APIs

🛡 Future Enhancements
Full DICOM image support
AI-based anatomical landmark detection
Haptic feedback support for AR organs
Cloud-based report-to-AR conversion pipeline
